im a writer, student and hobby coder (i feel like i need to call myself that)

If you like my work, thank my AI employees. They provide me what I need, when I need it, and when I'm wrong, they always get me on the right track. Sometimes, they hilucinate, but it seems to be getting better.

Well darn, that’s a lot of ideas. Amazing how I can tinker around my whole life and run into some luck. A nice fairytale would be that I cranked the ebrake on the side of the highway and sat there until now. To think some people are still parked, thinking about a solution that would already change the world, is sad if you didn’t know they’re cooked on 4 comedy specials of material. Get to work. Those tickets are pricy.

Inception is one of my fave movies!
